# Unity Converters for Newtonsoft.Json changelog

## 1.1.0

- Added custom contract resolver to look for the
  `UnityEngine.SerializeFieldAttribute` and include attributed fields and
  properties appropriately. ([#38](https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity.Converters/issues/38))

- Added `UnityEngine.ScriptableObject` deserialization support by using the
  `ScriptableObject.Create(Type type)` method when reading the JSON.
  ([#33](https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity.Converters/issues/33),
  [#38](https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity.Converters/issues/38))

- Fixed IL2CPP builds failing due to usage of `__makeref` in
  `CullingGroupEventConverter`, `ColliderDistance2DConverter`, and
  `RandomStateConverter`
  ([#34](https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity.Converters/issues/34))

## 1.0.0

- ✨ Initial release

- ❤ Big love from these authors allowing me to take inspiration from their
  converters packages:

  - ParentElement <https://github.com/ianmacgillivray/Json-NET-for-Unity>
  - Wanzyee Studio <http://wanzyeestudio.blogspot.com/2017/03/jsonnet-converters.html>

- UnityConverterInitializer that registers converters on load

- Ensured via tests to work in Unity version:
  - 2018.4
  - 2019.2
  - 2020.1

- Ensured via tests to work with API compatibility:
  - .NET Standard 2.0

- Ensured via tests to work with Newtonsoft.Json version:
  - 12.0.3
