## Contributing

Thankful that you're even reading this :)

If you want to contribute, here's what you can do:

- **Spread the word!** ‚ù§ More users &rarr; more feedback &rarr; I get more
  will-power to work on this project. This is the best way to contribute!

- [Open an issue][issue-create]. Could be a feature request for a new converter,
  or maybe you've found a bug?

- [Tackle one of the unassigned issues][issue-list-unassigned]. If it looks like
  a fun task to solve and no one is assigned, then just comment on it and say
  that you would like to try it out.

- Open a PR with some new feature or issue solved. Remember to ask before
  starting to work on anything, so no two are working on the same thing.

  Having a feature request or issue pop up and having the submitter suggesting
  themselves to later add a PR for a solution is the absolute greatest gift
  a repository maintainer could ever receive. üéÅ
